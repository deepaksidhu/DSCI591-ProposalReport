To tackle their questions, our team will provide an overview of available data science techniques related to web services, and mainly focus on three techniques: time series forecasting, prediction on service satisfaction, and survey clustering.  The final report will highlight the value added by supplementing AA insights with data science techniques. The final deliverable is a Jupyter Book providing documentation for and the application of the selected data science techniques.\n"

    "According to www.similarweb.com, GoC is one of the top 20 websites visited in Canada. Hence, It’s useful to predict how many visitors would be visiting GoC's website daily. The data science application of **time series forecasting** will be used to predict traffic on the GoC's website. There seems to be a positive trend in website traffic. It started from 1M and reached 4M by the end of April 2021. Also, there is a strong seasonal signal with 7 days. The traffic is going down every weekend and then reaching the top every Monday. Also, there is a strong influence of external events such as there was a peak on 10/21/2019 because of Canadian election day.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given the fact that only 5% of visitors are invited to the survey, it is worthwhile to predict the satisfaction level of the rest based on their online behaviors with the GoC website. Those behaviors or attributes include geographic information, time spent on pages, and referral page sources, etc. Those visiting behaviors will be combined as features, and an empirical model will be evaluated and proposed.  As a result, the model  ({numref}`prediction-satisfaction`) will predict what the probable satisfaction is, and what role a feature plays in those variations.\n",

This project on GoC website will enhance and enrich the operation and management in GoC by using machine learning techniques to **predict satisfaction on web services**. Simple models will be initialized as Logistic regression, Random Forest in the binary prediction phase, followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN). Furthermore, page referring sequences will be parsed as sequential data to be applied in an LSTM model. To evaluate the model’s performance, the assessment criteria include accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. In phase two as multiclass prediction, RMSE is proposed to use as the starting metric.\n",

    "The findings of this predicting model involve two parts: the first part is the probable prediction of website satisfaction given a visit; the second is what behaviors are related to lower or higher satisfaction results. This will be helpful for the web analytics team, and public sectors to better understand visitors’ behavior and guidance towards web service redesign and maintenance. However, possible limitations are the interpretation of the web behaviors and the model implementation, the imbalanced training set, the possible incorporation and processing of open text data.\n"

Each topic cluster determined by the LDA model would be labeled by the major sentiment expressed in the distribution of the words that makes up the topic.

    "However, there are several limitations with the text data. First, there is only 3800 text feedback available for analysis. Hence, training a sophisticated clustering model would be a challenge. Another limitation is the complexity of cleaning and preprocessing text. Lastly, LDA is an unsupervised machine learning approach, hence we don’t have the correct notion of how many major topics are present in the text feedback. The team will deal with this issue by comparing the similarity scores of the topic-word distribution for different LDA models. In addition, we don’t have ground truth labels for the main topic of the visitors' feedback.\n",
